# ChangeClass
ChangeClass is a mini CSS framework that makes easy to write event based dynamic website design without the need of writing any JavaScript.

Please, if you want to participate with examples, or extending the capabilities of the library, or just having a problem where it could help you if it would be a bit more advanced, just drop an Issue, or clone the repository and edit the code yourself.

Thank you.
